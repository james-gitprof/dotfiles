Note to self:

When using this in WSL or linux setup, consider setting up .bashrc. 
Check the type of shell session you're in as well (login or non-login) as it determines whether you're gonna read from that .bashrc or not, especially in vscode
Sometimes vscode can be weird at times and not read the .bashrc despite starting as interactive shell by default without using the `--interactive` option...
